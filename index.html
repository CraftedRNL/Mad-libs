                        Last summer, my <span class="input" role="textbox" contenteditable> (Adjective)</span> friend <span class="input" role="textbox" contenteditable> (Name)</span> 
                        and I decided to take a road trip to <span class="input" role="textbox" contenteditable> (Place)</span>.
                         We packed our <span class="input" role="textbox" contenteditable> (Plural Noun)</span>, 
                         grabbed some <span class="input" role="textbox" contenteditable> (food)</span>, and hopped into my 
                         <span class="input" role="textbox" contenteditable> (Adjective)</span> (vehicle). 
                        The trip started off great until we took a wrong turn and ended up in (place). Suddenly, a (adjective) (animal) ran across the road, causing us to (verb) and nearly crash into a (adjective) (object). "This is so (adjective)!" I shouted. But instead of panicking, we decided to (verb) and see where the adventure would take us.
                        
                        We stopped at a (adjective) (building), where a (adjective) (person/occupation) greeted us. They offered us a (adjective) (food), which tasted like (something gross). Then, out of nowhere, a (adjective) (creature) appeared and started (verb ending in -ing) around us.
                        
                        "This is getting too (adjective)," said (name). So we jumped back into our (vehicle) and (verb, past tense) away as fast as we could. We finally made it to (place), but weâ€™ll never forget the time we accidentally ended up in (weird place) and almost got chased by a (adjective) (animal). Best trip ever!
